/**
 * DelegationService — fire-and-forget sub-task sessions, plus status of any session.
 *
 * `delegate` starts a brand-new session in any directory on any engine and returns a
 * receipt at once; nothing is stored server-side (the receipt, returned to the caller's
 * transcript, IS the record). `status` derives a session's state on read from the run
 * registry and the transcript's own terminal markers.
 *
 * Live implementation: packages/feature/agent/src/effect/delegationLive.ts
