/**
 * Session DTOs — the shapes the session APIs return and the session lists render.
 *
 * Why they live here: `shared/` is feature-agent's client-importable zone (no
 * node built-ins, same rule as botSession.ts), and a session is agent-domain
 * data. The tab strip and SessionBrowser sit in feature-workspace, which is
 * allowed to depend on feature-agent — so one declaration reaches every reader.
 *
 * Why they exist at all: each of these two shapes had FOUR hand-written copies —
 * the server builder, the route, and one per consuming component. Adding a
 * single optional field (`bot`) meant seven edits, and the eighth copy
 * (server/api/sessions.ts, an endpoint with no callers left) silently diverged
 * without anyone noticing. Field lists now live in exactly one place; the old
 * local names survive as aliases where a module's own vocabulary reads better.
